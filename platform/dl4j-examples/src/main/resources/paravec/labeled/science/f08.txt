A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.
Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.
The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.
The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.
Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.
Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The biasâ€“variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.
In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.
In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.
There are two kinds of time complexity results.
Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time.
Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.
There are many similarities between machine learning theory and statistical inference, although they use different terms.
