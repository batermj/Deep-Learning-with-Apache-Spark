A healthy diet is usually defined as a diet in which nutrient intake is maintained, and cholesterol, salt, sugar, and fat are reduced.
The idea of a healthy diet is something used by a government to ensure that people are well "protected" against common illnesses and conditions which stem from poor diet.
This could include headaches, lessened sexual drive, heart disease, alcohol poisoning, or obesity.
A healthy diet is a way of eating that that reduces risk for complications such as heart disease and stroke.
Healthy eating includes eating a wide variety of foods including: vegetables, whole grains, fruits, non-fat dairy products, beans, lean meats, poultry, fish
The definition of a healthy diet is sometimes also thought of as a diet which will combat or prevent illness.
Although the majority of people would support this definition, few know why, other than because "bad" foods are not consumed.
People with healthy diets are less likely to succumb to common minor illnesses, such as lesser forms of Influenza, mainly because consumption of a healthy diet would provide ample nutrients and energy for the body, so as to help stave off such illnesses.
Similarly, the healthy diet can also be used this way to aid the body during illness.
The myth of "feed a cold, starve a fever" is a common misconception among the public, particularly in the United Kingdom.
This is a myth in every sense of the word because providing the body with nutrients during illness is actually beneficial - nutrient and energy stores would be replenished, allowing for more energy to be used by the body to combat illness.
