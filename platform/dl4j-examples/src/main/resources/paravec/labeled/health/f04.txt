The selective toxicity of vitamin C for cancer cells has been demonstrated repeatedly in cell culture studies.
The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recently published a paper demonstrating vitamin C killing cancer cells.
As of 2005, some physicians have called for a more careful reassessment of vitamin C, especially intravenous vitamin C, in cancer treatment.
With two colleagues, Pauling founded the Institute of Orthomolecular Medicine in Menlo Park, California, in 1973, which was soon renamed the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine.
Pauling directed research on vitamin C, but also continued his theoretical work in chemistry and physics until his death in 1994.
In his last years, he became especially interested in the possible role of vitamin C in preventing atherosclerosis and published three case reports on the use of lysine and vitamin C to relieve angina pectoris.
In 1996, the Linus Pauling Institute moved from Palo Alto, California, to Corvallis, Oregon, to become part of Oregon State University, where it continues to conduct research on micronutrients, phytochemicals (chemicals from plants), and other constituents of the diet in preventing and treating disease.
